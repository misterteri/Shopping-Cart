# What I learned from this project

- What is React(1):

  - **useful** for building Beautiful UIs and sets up fairly quickly
  - **not good** for games, animations, and other complex things

- Steps to create a React App:

  - `npm create-react-app shopping-cart`
  - `cd shopping-cart`
  - `npm start`

- differences between `npm` and `npx`(2):
  - `npm` is a package manager
  - `npx` is a package runner

# What needs to be done to improve this project

- deploy with vercel
- usage of a real database
- connect it with a backend
